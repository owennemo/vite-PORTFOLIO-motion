# vite-ANIMATED-PORTFOLIO-motion

Hi, everyone.

In this Repository I learned to create a portfolio website along with the information in it which was obtained through a tutorial from one of the Youtuber programmer, namely Lama Dev (https://www.youtube.com/@LamaDev). Here are some things I learned in this tutorial:

1. How to use the react vite template provided by another repository by forking
2. How to use SCSS (Sassy Cascading Style Sheets) to style web displays like when using regular CSS
3. How to use framer motion to provide animation on the website that we create
4. How to use @mixin to implement responsive design where mobile uses the dimensions of the iPhone 12 Pro as the default reference
5. How to use Emailjs for a contact form where the data entered can be sent to the website owner's email address

!!! ISSUE !!!

I had a problem, when deploying to github pages, some of the image assets that were supposed to appear did not appear (you can check in the repo link). If you can help me solve this problem, I would really appreciate your help. ðŸ˜Š
